Lost at the junction of life and consciousness,
being aware of complexity seems to be a beautiful predicament.
Colors and sounds create a mosaic trompe l'oeil,
as now euphoria is deciphered as a play of endorphins in the mighty brain.

My mind searches for eternal tranquility,
while my brain reasons the crude reality.
The warmth of life is presently reduced to being a string of photons,
and all human intricate feelings just to the chaotic firing of the limbic masters in our control center.

I wonder at the simplex complexity and the Tao of life,
as I know all that awaits is a dance of fractals.
They dance to varying frequencies in an energy field,
as there is no color no sound only pure awareness dipped in illusion.

Solidity and vanity are fueled by atomic vibrations,
while the serene colors of the sky are an amalgamation of diverse wavelengths.
Life seems to be a maze, while my companion coffee causes positive ionotropic effects,
and my sweet tooth spells the chant for my sweet dreams.

Well, I realize I live in a holographic universe,
with innumerable possibilities like the Schrodinger's cat.
Infinite things such as placebo still haunt our reasoning,
as we are akin to a robot in a Chinese room as what we know is an iota in the sea of reality.
