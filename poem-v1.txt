When we think as far as our world lines, our thoughts become movements
in space, motions, time, threads curved as thoughts recording the mind writing relative, 
tangled motions, knotting intricate paths like strands of DNA intertwined.
The mind of a knot is a continuous curve through space, writing woven,
locations of particles traveling as their orbits in spacetime knot particles
of indefinite location. The world mind is a record that orbits its knotted history.
The poem, an indefinite knot threaded in a continuous curve of mind's space,
computes qubits, its world lines the braided motions of mind's memory.
