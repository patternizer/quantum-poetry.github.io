# quantum_poetry

Python implementation of World Lines quantum poetry by Professor Amy Catanzano https://www.amycatanzano.com/world-lines

An interactive app has been developed for testing here: http://quantum-poetry.herokuapp.com/

## Contents

* `quantum_poetry.py` - main script to be run with Python 3.6+
* `app.py` - Plotly Dash interactive app script to be run with Python 3.6+

The first step is to clone the latest quantum_poetry code and step into the check out directory: 

    $ git clone https://github.com/patternizer/quantum_poetry.git
    $ cd quantum_poetry
    
### Using Standard Python 

The code should run with the [standard CPython](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installation and was tested 
in a conda virtual environment running a 64-bit version of Python 3.6+.

quantum_poetry can be run from sources directly, once the modules in requirements.txt are resolved.


Run with:

    $ python quantum_poetry.py
	
A static version of the app can be run locally with:

    $ python app.py
